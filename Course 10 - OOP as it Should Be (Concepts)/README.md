# 10 - OOP as It Should Be (Concepts)

This course focuses on building **correct Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) thinking**.  
It explains *why* OOP exists, *when* to use it, and *how* to apply it properly without misuse or overengineering.

The course emphasizes understanding concepts before implementation.

## 📘 Course Overview

During this course, I developed a solid and accurate understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts and design principles.

The course bridges the gap between procedural thinking and OOP thinking, and prepares learners for advanced OOP and system design.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Throughout this course, I learned and applied:

- What OOP is and why it exists  
- Differences between procedural programming and OOP thinking  
- Designing and using classes and objects correctly  
- Understanding objects in memory  
- Access specifiers and properties  
- Encapsulation and abstraction  
- Constructors, destructors, and copy constructors  
- Static members and methods  
- Safe use of inheritance  
- Polymorphism, virtual functions, and dynamic binding  
- Interfaces, abstract classes, and pure virtual functions  
- Organizing code using libraries and reusable components

## 🛠 Projects & Tasks

### Practical Tasks
- Practical exercises were applied after each lesson  
> Solutions will be added later  

### Practical Projects (C++)

Several projects were implemented to apply OOP concepts correctly:

- 💻 **Calculator Project**  
- 💻 **String Library Project**  
- 💻 **Date Library Project**  
- 💻 **Period Class Design**

These projects focused on:
- Proper class design  
- Reusability and clean structure  
- Applying OOP concepts in realistic scenarios

## 📌 Notes

This course helped me build **correct OOP thinking**, not just memorize concepts.  
It taught me when to use OOP, when not to, and how to design cleaner and more maintainable programs.

By the end of this course, I became confident reading, understanding, and designing OOP-based systems, and ready to move forward to advanced OOP and design patterns.
