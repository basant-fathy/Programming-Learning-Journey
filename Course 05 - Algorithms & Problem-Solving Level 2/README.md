# 05 - Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2

This course is an advanced continuation of algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.  
It focuses on solving more complex and interconnected programming problems, while strengthening analytical thinking and structured solution design using **C++**.

This course represents a major step forward in both problem-solving depth and practical application.

## 📘 Course Overview

During this course:

- Solved **50 interconnected programming problems** with increasing difficulty  
- Problems were more advanced compared to Level 1  
- Emphasis was placed on logical thinking, analysis, and solution design  
- Advanced problem-solving techniques were practiced extensively  

Some notable challenges included:

- Identifying **Perfect Numbers**  
- Guessing a **3-letter password**  
- **Encrypting and decrypting** text  
- Handling **repeated elements**  
- **Shuffling ordered arrays**

## 📌 Notes

This course significantly changed my programming mindset.  
Working on real projects helped me understand how functions interact with each other and how to properly structure and organize code.

By the end of this course, I was able to complete both projects independently.  
The experience strengthened my ability to analyze problems, design efficient solutions, and write clean, maintainable C++ code.
