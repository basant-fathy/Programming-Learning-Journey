# 02 - Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 1

This course focuses on introducing algorithms and problem-solving concepts in a very simple and gradual way.  
The main goal is to build logical thinking, analytical skills, and structured reasoning needed to solve problems.

The course relies heavily on **flowcharts** to explain ideas clearly before moving to any actual coding.

## 📘 Topics Covered

During this course, I learned:

- Fundamentals of algorithms  
- Problem-solving concepts and methodology  
- Logical and analytical thinking  
- Breaking problems into clear, ordered steps  
- Using flowcharts to represent solutions  
- Understanding how computers approach problem-solving  
- Developing structured thinking suitable for programming

## 🛠 Projects & Code

This course is **theoretical and conceptual**.  
There are no projects or code implementations, as the focus was on training the mind to think logically and systematically using flowcharts rather than writing code.
