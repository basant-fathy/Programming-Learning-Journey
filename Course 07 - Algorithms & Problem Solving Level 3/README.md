## 🛠 Projects & Tasks

### Algorithmic Problems
- Solved **50 diverse and progressively challenging problems**
- Problems focused on logical thinking, data manipulation, and algorithmic efficiency

### Practical Projects (C++)

Two practical projects were developed using **C++**, focusing on real-world use cases:

- 💻 **Bank 1 – Bank Management System**  
  A system that simulates basic banking operations such as:
  - Adding clients  
  - Updating client data  
  - Deleting clients  
  - Managing account balances  

- 💻 **Bank Extension**  
  An extension of the previous project that includes:
  - Deposit and withdrawal transactions  
  - Full data persistence using text files  
  - Treating files as a **simple database** through file handling

## 📌 Notes

This course significantly enhanced my ability to apply algorithms to **realistic use cases**.  
Working with files as a simple database and organizing code using structured programming principles helped me better understand **clean code practices** and system-level thinking.

By the end of this course, I felt confident translating abstract algorithmic ideas into practical, working solutions.
