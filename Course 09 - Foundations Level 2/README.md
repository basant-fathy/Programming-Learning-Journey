# 09 - Foundations – Level 2

This course focuses on understanding how real-world software systems work.  
It connects programming knowledge to networking, internet infrastructure, backend systems, and system architecture.

The goal of this course is to build **technical awareness**, not to write code.

## 📘 Course Overview

During this course, I developed a clear understanding of how software systems operate beyond the code itself.

The course prepares learners mentally and technically for:
- Backend development  
- APIs and web systems  
- Networking concepts  
- Security fundamentals  
- Large-scale and distributed systems  

It acts as a bridge between programming fundamentals and real-world software systems.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Throughout this course, I learned:

- How data is transferred over computer networks  
- Core networking concepts such as:
  - TCP/IP
  - Packets, ports, and sockets  
- IP addressing concepts:
  - IPv4 and IPv6
  - Subnet masks
  - Different types of IPs  
- The role of routers, gateways, modems, and ISPs  
- DNS, domains, subdomains, and URLs  
- HTTP vs HTTPS and secure communication  
- Client–server architecture and server roles  
- APIs and how they are used in real systems  
- Data formats such as JSON, XML, and GUIDs  
- 3-tier architecture  
- Basic security concepts and risks  
- Why large software systems are complex and expensive

## 🛠 Projects & Tasks

This course is **fully conceptual**.

- No coding tasks or projects  
- Focus is on understanding systems, not implementation  
- Designed to build strong mental models of how software operates in real environments

## 📌 Notes

This course helped me think beyond writing code and understand what happens behind every API call and network request.

It strengthened my ability to reason about system behavior, failures, and architecture, and prepared me to learn backend and web technologies more efficiently with a professional mindset.
