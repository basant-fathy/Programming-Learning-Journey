# 08 - Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 4

This course represents an advanced stage in algorithmic problem-solving and analytical thinking using **C++**.  
It focuses on writing **clean, efficient, and optimized code** while solving real-world inspired problems.

This level goes beyond solving problems to understanding *how* and *why* solutions work efficiently.
