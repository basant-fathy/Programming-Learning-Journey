# 04 - Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 1 Solutions

This course is a practical continuation of **Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 1**.  
It focuses on implementing real solutions for all previously studied algorithmic problems using **C++**, transforming flowchart-based thinking into actual executable code.

This course represents a key transition from conceptual problem-solving to applied programming.

---

## 📘 Course Overview

During this course:

- All problems from **Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 1** were revisited  
- Flowchart-based solutions were converted into real C++ implementations  
- Multiple programming concepts were combined to solve problems in a structured way  
- The course emphasized practical training and gradual improvement in problem-solving skills  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

The solutions were implemented using various C++ programming concepts, including:

- Functions  
- Structures  
- Enums  
- Loops  
- Arrays  
- Conditional statements  
- Operators  
- General problem decomposition and logical flow

## 🛠 Projects & Tasks

- This course consists of **50 algorithmic problems**  
- Each problem represents a solution to a flowchart from the previous course  
- All problems were solved **independently** using C++  
- Solutions will be added to this course folder later  

> These tasks serve as practical exercises to strengthen algorithmic thinking and coding skills.

## 📌 Notes

This course bridges the gap between theoretical algorithms and real programming implementation.  
It plays a crucial role in building confidence when solving problems and applying multiple programming concepts together in C++.
